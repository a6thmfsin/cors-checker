# cors-checker
CORS Checker, check for acac header in response using Origin and Referer headers.
Sends 2 different requests to a input of endpoints adding Origin and Referer header to the request using https://google.com as a suffix, you can ofc change this to your collab server. 
And then writes it out to either referer-acao.txt or origin-acao.txt (now i noticed script will have ACAO written all over instead of ACAC due to last moment changes but will work just fine.
